# Snake-Game-Pure-JavaScript
After larning more about clean and optmized code in-depth.
This project enables me to implement clean code and re-fresh my skils in pure HTML | CSS | JavaScript once again.

## Project Description
This is a classsical snake game. I'm pretty sure you must have played this before.
When the game starts, snake moves and you help him eat the food. while keeping 2 things in mind.
1- You do not hit the wall otherwise the game will over.
2- You do not hit snake's own body by taking turns.
And that's it. You keep helping snake eat the food the snake become bigger and bigger so does your score increase and so he complexity.
